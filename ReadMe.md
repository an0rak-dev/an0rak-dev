## About Me

I'm a tech enthusiast (mostly about Computer science, but any science is fun), happy husband and father of 2 !

By day I work at [Shadow](https://shadow.tech) as a TechLead regarding the company's CICD strategy. By night I spend most of my time working on VR stuff. You can find some of things I decide to release about this [here](https://github.com/kingdom-of-dreams). I'm currently working on a game engine which targets VR as a first class citizen, and performance over the rest.

I also love to code other things, you know, usually everything I can found or think of.

## Where to find me ?
